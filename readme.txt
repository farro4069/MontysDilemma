The Monty Hall problem.

Monty Hall was the host of a TV game show "Let's make a deal".

On the show, contestants vied for the chance to win a car. 

This was done by chosing between three doors, behind one of which was concealed the car. 

Having nominated a door, Monty would open one of the remaining doors revealing a goat and improving the contestant's chance of winning. 

To increase their chance of winning, though, the contestant needs to switch doors. Doing so increases the probabilty from one in three (for the original guess) to two in three, based on Bayes' Theorem. 

This web based simulation allows the user to play multiple games and test the results. 

Thanks to the coding train for the inspiration.
